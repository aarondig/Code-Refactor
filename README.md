## About This Project

In this project, existing HTML on the Horiseon landing page was cleaned up and refactored to read as semantic HTML. While many physical elements remained the same, the objective was to achieve organized and easily readable HTML while not changing the elements and layout of the page.

### What is Semantic HTML?

  **DIV** elements are often overused as an end-all-be-all for defining classes, ids, or other properties of a code. Unlike **DIVs**, semantic elements like **Header**, **Nav**, or **Article**, are much more descriptive ways of defining properties behind the face of the webpage.
